## What are random feature maps?
Random feature maps are promising methods for large-scale kernel methods.
They are maps from a original feature space to a randomized feature space 
approximating a kernel-induced feature space.
The idea is to run linear models on such randomized feature space for 
classification, regression, clustering, etc.
When the dimension of the random feature map D is not so high and the number of
training example N is large, this approach is very efficient compared to 
canonical kernel methods.

## Random Feature Maps Implemented
pyrfm follows the scikit-learn API and now **supports following random features**.

 - random Fourier feature (for the RBF kernel) [1]
 - signed circulant random Fourier feature (for the RBF kernel) [2]
 - random Maclaurin feature (for the polynomial kernel, exp kernel, and 
 user-specified dot product kernels) [3]
 - tensor sketching (for the polynomial kernel) [4]
 - random kernel feature (for the ANOVA kernel and all-subsets kernel) [5]
 - signed circulant random kernel feature (for the ANOVA kernel) [5]
 - S.Maji and A.Berg feature (for the intersection (min) kernel) (this feature 
 is not random) [6]
 
In other words, pyrfm now **provides approximaters for following kernels**.
 - RBF kernel (random Fourier, signed circulant random Fourier)
 - polynomial kernel (random Maclaurin, tensor sketching)
 - exponential kernel (random Maclaurin)
 - user-specified dot product kernel (random Maclaurin, requiring Maclaurin 
 coefficients of specified kernel)
 - ANOVA kernel (random kernel, signed circulant random kernel)
 - all-subsets kernel (random kernel)
 - intersection (min) kernel (S.Maji and A.Berg)
  
The random Fourier feature is also implemented in scikit-learn 
(kernel_approximation.RBFSampler).

Moreover, pyrfm supports following structured random features.
 - SignedCirculantRandomMatrix (for dot product / RBF kernel) [2]
 - SubsampledRandomHadamardTransform (for dot product) [11]
 - FastFood (for dot product / RBF kernel) [12]
 - CompactRandomFeatures [13] (with SubsampledRanadomHadamardTransform or RandomProjection [14])
 - OrthogonalRandomFeature / StructuredOrthogonalRandomFeature (for dot product / RBF kernel) [15]

We believe that you can use these structured random features as a subroutine of your proposed random features.

## Linear Models Implemented
Moreover, pyrfm **supports following solvers for linear models with random features**.
 - primal coordinate descent for sparse S.Maji and A.Berg feature [6,7]
 - AdaGrad for very-large-scale dataset: does not compute the random feature map
  of all examples at the same time (space efficient but slow) [8]
 - SDCA for very-large-scale dataset: does not compute the random feature map
  of all examples at the same time (space efficient but slow) [9]
 - Adam for very-large-scale dataset: does not compute the random feature map
  of all examples at the same time (space efficient but slow) [10]
  
 All methods support squared loss for regression and hinge loss, squared hinge loss, and logistic loss for classification.
 
 AdaGrad, SDCA, and Adam in pyrfm are for a very-large-scale dataset such that computing its random feature matrix (i.e., computing random features for all instances at the same time)
 causes MemoryError.
 If you can allocate memory for random feature matrix of your training data, you should use the other implementations of linear models (linear_model in scikit-learn, sklearn-contrib-lightning, etc). 
 Now, these stochastic solvers run efficiently for following random features.
  - RBFSampler (in sklearn.kernel_approximation)
  - RandomFourier
  - RandomMaclaurin
  - TensorSketch
  - RandomKernel
  - SignedCirculantRandomProjection
  - FastFood
  - SubsampledRandomHadamardTransform
  - CompactRandomFeature
  - OrthogonalRandomFeature / StructuredOrthogonalRandomFeature
  
 
 For improving efficiency, implement cdef class and cdef transform method for your desired transformer.
 Please see random_feature/random_features_fast.pyx/pxd.
 Although these stochastic solvers **support any transformers, they might run unbelievable slow** when there is no cdef class and cdef transform method for your desired transformer in random_features_fast.pyx/pxd.
